"""Per-session risk scoring and forced-session-kill enforcement.

Real telemetry only: this accumulates a score from signals the backend can
actually observe (failed logins, injection-shaped input, privilege-escalation
attempts, rate-limit trips) against a specific *already-authenticated*
session. It does not and cannot observe anything about a user's local
network, Wi-Fi, or hardware (MAC addresses aren't exposed to a web server or
a browser page — there's no legitimate way for a website to see either).

Enforcement is server-side and is the actual kill switch: once a session's
score crosses the threshold, every subsequent authenticated request using
that session is rejected (see auth.py's admin_required/employee_required).
The SSE stream in app.py exists only so an *already-open* browser tab finds
out immediately instead of waiting for its next click — it is a UX nicety
on top of server-side enforcement, never a substitute for it. A client that
ignores the SSE message entirely still gets locked out on its very next
request.
