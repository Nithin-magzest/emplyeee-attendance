"""Decoy TCP listeners — "system32_crypto_admin" — for ports nothing
legitimate on this stack ever uses (FTP 21, Telnet 23, SMTP 25, MSSQL
1433, MySQL 3306, RDP 3389 — see terraform/honeypot.tf for why these six).

Any connection here is unambiguous: there is no real service behind any
of these ports, so every single hit is either a port scan or an active
exploitation attempt, never a false positive from a legitimate user. That
certainty is what makes it safe to page on immediately (see
send_security_alert below) in a way a real-service anomaly detector never
could be.

Deliberately minimal — no protocol emulation, no parsing of what the
client sends. This process never interprets attacker-supplied bytes as
anything other than opaque logging data, which is what keeps a honeypot
itself from becoming the next vulnerability. It accepts a connection,
waits briefly for whatever the client sends, logs it, and closes.

Runs as its own tiny standalone process (see honeypot_entrypoint.py) —
no Flask, no DB dependency, so it starts and keeps running independently
of the main app's health.
