"""Pure helper functions for the leave/holiday/overtime blueprint.

Extracted from app.py rather than imported back from it — wsgi.py registers
blueprints before `import app as _app_module`, so a blueprint importing from
app.py would trigger app.py's full module body (route registration, DB
bootstrap) out of order. Neither function here touches the DB directly
(assign_leave_balances_for_employee takes a cursor as a dependency), so
extraction is safe.
