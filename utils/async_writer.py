"""In-process async write queue for high-frequency security bookkeeping.

Measured problem this solves: under a brute-force flood against one
identifier, every failed attempt did a synchronous `UPDATE ... failed_count
= failed_count + 1` on the request-handling thread. Concurrent requests
serialize on that row's lock plus the connection pool (maxconn=20), and
each gunicorn worker sits blocked for the full wait. Measured with 60
concurrent failed attempts against one identifier: median per-request
latency 3.0s, max 5.8s — long enough that every legitimate, unrelated
request would also be starved of a worker for the same window. That's the
exact failure mode asked about: security-event handling degrading
availability for real users during an attack.

Why not Celery/Redis (asked three times this session now, same answer):
this app's actual scale doesn't need a distributed broker, and critically,
adding one here would mean the enqueue step — the thing that MUST stay
fast during a flood — now depends on a network hop to Redis also staying
healthy under the same load. An in-process queue.Queue has zero moving
parts to fail: no socket, no broker to overload, nothing to reconnect to.
It works because this is single-process-per-worker; if this app ever runs
multiple worker PROCESSES needing state shared across them (not just
threads within one), that's the point a real broker earns its keep.

Durability tradeoff, stated plainly: this queue is in-memory and does not
survive a process crash or restart. Losing a few failed-login-counter
increments or risk-score points in that scenario is acceptable — lockout
and session-risk scoring are defense-in-depth, not the primary auth
boundary (password verification and CSRF stay fully synchronous, never
queued). This is NOT an acceptable tradeoff for something like email
delivery, which is why email_queue stays Postgres-backed and untouched by
this module — different durability class, deliberately different design.
