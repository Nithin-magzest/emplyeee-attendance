"""Data Loss Prevention: field-level PII masking and clearance checks.

Generalizes a pattern that already existed hand-rolled in one place —
payroll.py's view_payslip restricts unmasked PAN/UAN/bank details to
admin_role=="admin" specifically, and utils/salary_utils.py masks the bank
account to its last 4 digits — so every other admin-tier route showing the
same class of data (employee_detail, employee_profile, bulk salary lists)
can reuse one definition of "who has clearance" and one masking format
instead of each hand-rolling its own.
