# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AWS Network Firewall — genuine NGFW: stateful deep packet inspection,
# Suricata-compatible IDS/IPS rule evaluation, protocol filtering.
#
# Closes the NGFW gap noted in FIREWALL_ARCHITECTURE.md #4 (previously
# covered only piecemeal by WAF + ClamAV + Flask-Limiter, none of which do
# real packet inspection). Real ongoing cost: ~$0.395/hr per firewall
# endpoint (~$285/month) + $0.065/GB processed, billed continuously once
# applied, independent of traffic volume — confirm this is actually wanted
# before running terraform apply.
#
# RESOURCE-COMPLETE, TRAFFIC-PATH-INCOMPLETE: this file creates the
# firewall, its rule group, and its policy, and associates it with
# var.firewall_subnet_ids. It does NOT create or modify VPC route tables.
# AWS Network Firewall only inspects traffic that a route table explicitly
# sends through its endpoint (app subnet -> firewall subnet -> IGW, and
# back) — this project's vpc_id/subnet_ids are pre-existing, externally
# managed infrastructure (see main.tf's header comment), and this Terraform
# config has never managed route tables anywhere. Wiring the real traffic
# path means editing the existing route tables for the app's subnet and
# the IGW-facing subnet, which isn't captured here — a real network change
# to plan deliberately against your actual VPC layout, not a mechanical
# follow-on to `terraform apply`.
